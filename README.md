## Your assignement

Imagine you are the lead data scientist of Magenta and have the task to pitch a new use case for upselling activities to the marketing department.
Purpose of the project is to use machine learning to optimize which customers to approach and which products to recommend in upselling campaigns.

> Upselling: A customer buys a better and more expensive version of a product. Imagine he/she already has mobile contract with 10GB - but will now buy a tariff with 50GB after an intervention/marketing activity.

Your assignement is composed of 2 parts: coding part and presentation part.
For coding part, of course, it would be great if you could integrate your code in this repository using the info decribed before.

For presentation part you can use which ever tool you prefer.
Prepare a 15 minute presentation.

Choose a wording suitable for the non tech affine business stakeholders.

Make sure to outline the following:

- How would you communicate the business value of your solution to the stakeholders  
- What is a clear metric to measure the success of your project?  
- How would you compute the business value generated by your model?  
- Which stakeholders would you include at which point of the project  
- Modelling approach (input features, model type, evaluation...)



## advanced usage
# ## docker

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml --profile dagster_onprem up --build
```

### .env  file

Post install:

- update the secrets in the `.env` files by executing: `openssl rand -base64 32` and setting a suitable secret
- ensure the `.env.enc` can be created by following the instructions in [documentation/secops]

here you find an example `.env` file which should have been auto-generated
